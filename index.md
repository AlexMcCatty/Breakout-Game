## Post Mortem

This project was a bit hectic.  I realized on Sunday night that it was due on Monday, having not started it at all.  I did the whole thing in 2 days.
If I had another 8 weeks to work on this, well... I'm not really sure what I would do with that much time.  This is a pretty simple game and I don't think I would want to turn it into something much more complex.  I like the simplicity.

One thing I would do is clean up my code a bit, the time crunch doesn't lend itself to particulatly neat coding.  An improvemnt I would like to make to the game would be to automatically resize the blocks so that they fit the screen well when intializing a level.  As it is you have to be careful not to add too many columns or some of the blocks end up off the screen and the level is un-winable.  Or you can mess with the size options in the code.
